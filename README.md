# iOS Architecture Patterns Study

This repository contains practical examples of various iOS architecture patterns and development concepts, demonstrating clean code practices and modern Swift development techniques.

## üìö Examples Included

### 1. Clean Architecture Example (`Clean-Example/`)
A comprehensive implementation of Clean Architecture principles in iOS, featuring:
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, Use Cases, and Repository protocols
- **Data Layer**: Data sources and repository implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: ViewModels and Views using SwiftUI
- **Dependency Injection**: DIContainer for managing dependencies

### 2. Dependency Injection Example (`DependencyInjection-Example/`)
Demonstrates different approaches to dependency injection in SwiftUI:
- Custom DI Container implementation
- Environment-based injection
- Service protocols and implementations
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. Networking Layer Example (`NetworkingLayer-Example/`)
A robust networking layer implementation showcasing:
- Protocol-based network service architecture
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Mock implementations for testing
- Comprehensive unit tests
- User management with CRUD operations

### 4. Coordinators Example (`Coordinators-Example/`)
Navigation management using the Coordinator pattern:
- App-level coordination
- Deep link handling
- Modular view navigation
- Separation of navigation logic from views

### 5. VIPER Architecture Example (`Viper-Example/`)
Complete VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) implementation:
- Todo application demonstrating all VIPER components
- Modular architecture with clear responsibilities
- Navigation routing between modules

## üéØ Learning Objectives

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to any example folder
3. Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode
4. Build and run the project

## üìã Requirements
